# ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing on Train Dataset
## ðŸ“– Description

This project focuses on analyzing and preprocessing a dataset to understand its structure, clean missing values, handle duplicates, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). The aim is to prepare the dataset for further statistical modeling tasks by ensuring data quality and extracting useful insights through visualization and statistical methods.

## ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Steps performed in the notebook include:

Data Loading â€“ Importing the dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values, duplicates, and checking data types.

Descriptive Statistics â€“ Using .describe() and .info() to summarize the dataset.

Data Visualization â€“ Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot distributions and relationships.

Stationarity Test â€“ Applied to check if the dataset exhibits time series properties.

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas â€“ For data manipulation and cleaning

NumPy â€“ For numerical computations

Matplotlib â€“ For data visualization

Seaborn â€“ For advanced statistical plots

statsmodels â€“ for statistical testing
